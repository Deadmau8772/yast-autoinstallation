	A standard Linux installation asks many questions about what to
	install, what hardware to configure, how to configure the network
	interface, etc. Answering these questions once is informative and maybe
	even fun. But imagine a system engineer who has to set up a new Linux
	network with a large number of machines. Now, the same issues need to
	be addressed and the same questions answered repeatedly. This makes the
	task very inefficient, not to mention a source of irritation and
	boredom. Hence, a need arises to automate this parameter and option
	selection.</quote>

      <quote>The thought of simply copying the hard disks naturally crosses one's
	mind. This can be done quickly, and all the necessary functions and
	software will be copied without option selection. However, the fact is
	that simple copying of hard disks causes the individual computers to
	become too similar. This, in turn, creates an altogether new mission of
	having to reconfigure the individual settings on each PC. For example,
	IP addresses for each machine will have to be reset. If this is not
	done properly, strange and inexplicable behavior results.</quote>
