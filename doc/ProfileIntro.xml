      The control file is in most cases a  configuration description for a
      single system. It consists of
      sets of resources with properties including support for complex
      structures representations such as lists, records, 
      trees and large embedded or referenced objects.

      The simplest way to to create the control file is by using a regular
      editor. You can use one of the many XML editors available or use your
      favourite text editor with XML support (i.e. Emacs, Vim). However, it is not quite
      optimal to create the control file manually for large sets of machines
      and it should only be seen as an interface between the auto-installation engine and the Configuration
      Management System (<abbrev>CMS</abbrev>).
