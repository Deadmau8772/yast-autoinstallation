	By adding scripts to the auto-installation process you can customize the
	installation for your needs and take control in different stages of the
	installation.

      <para>
	In the auto-installation process, three types of scripts can be executed:

	  <para>Pre-Install Scripts</para>
	  <para>Executed before &yast2; does any real change of the system

      <para>
	All  but the pre-install scripts can be written in either shell or
	perl script language. When added to the control file manually, the
      scripts have to be included in a <emphasis>CDATA</emphasis> element to avoid confusion with
	the file syntax and other tags defined in the file.

	After installation is finished, the scripts and the output logs can be

      Using the sysconfig resource, you will be able to define configuration
      variables in the sysconfig repository
      (<filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename>) directly. Using the sysconfig
      variables, you will beable to fine-tune many system components and
      environment variables exactly to your needs.

      <title>Adding complete configurations</title>
      <para>
	For many applications and services you might have prepared a
	configuration file which should be copied in a complete form to some
	location in the installed system. This is for example if you are
	installing  a web server and have a <emphasis>ready to go</emphasis>
	server configuration file (<filename>httpd.conf</filename>).
      </para>
      <para>
	Using this resource, you can embbed the file into the control file by
	specifying the final path on the installed system. &yast2; will copy this
	file to the specified location.
