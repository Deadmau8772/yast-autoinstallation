	<title>Creating/Editing a Control File Manually</title>
    <para>
      If you edit the control file manually, make sure it  has a valid syntax. The
      easy way to check the syntax is by using some tools already available
      on the distribution. For example to verify that the file is well
      formed, use the utility <command>xmllint</command> available with the
    <emphasis>libxml2</emphasis> package:     
    </para>
    <screen>
xmllint &lt;control file&gt;
    </screen>
    <para>
      If the control file is not well formed, i.e. if a tag is not closed,
      <command>xmllint</command> will report about the errors.
    </para>    
    <para>
      Before going on with the auto-installation, please fix any errors
      resulting from such checks. The auto-installation process can't be
      started with  an invalid and non-well formed control file.
