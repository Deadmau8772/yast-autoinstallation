      In order to ease and automate Linux installations,  &company-suse;
      offers AutoYaST2. AutoYaST2 lets the user create a configuration for a
      system to be installed and automatically performs the installation if the
      configuration is provided to &yast2; during installation.

      Using AutoYaST2, multiple systems sharing the same environment and
      hardware performing similar tasks can easily be installed in parallel. A
      configuration  file (referred to as "control  file") is created using
      existing configuration resources and it can be easily tailored for any
      specific settings. This chapter will guide you through the three steps of
      auto-installation:

      The auto-installation process can be split  into three major parts:
      <emphasis>Booting and Boot Management</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>Installation</emphasis> and <emphasis>System Configuration</emphasis>.
      The following figure illustrates the process of the auto-installation:

      Auto-Installation is  interesting when installing large number
      of machines which at least have one thing in common. For example
      auto-installation can be used for installing a network of workstations
      which share the same environment and have similar hardware and will be
      performing similar tasks.
