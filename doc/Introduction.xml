      &autoyast2; is the system for installing one ore more SuSE Linux systems
      automatically and without user intervention. Using &autoyast2;, you can
      create a configuration for a single system or a set of systems  to
      control automated  installations. The <emphasis>control file</emphasis>
      can be  provided to &yast2; during installation in different ways.

      <title>Availability</title>
      <para>
	&autoyast2; is available with recent  &company-suse; products starting
	from <emphasis>SuSE Linux 8.0</emphasis> and will be available with
	business products based on <emphasis>SLES 8</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>Old products perior to SuSE Linux 8.0 and business products relying
	on <emphasis>SLES 7</emphasis> have an auto-installation
	system relying on <emphasis>YaST</emphasis>. A configuration management
	system is provided by <emphasis>Alice</emphasis> for these products.

      <title>Motivation</title>
      	&IntroductionLinuxJournal;
      <para>
	If you have installed SuSE Linux recently, you will notice that the
	installation system acts somehow in an automated way. The user is
	requested to select the necessary information at the beginning of the
	installation (Normally Language only) and &yast2; will generate a
	propsal for the underlying system depending on different factors. In
	most cases, and especially for new systems, such a proposal needs not
	to be changed and can be used to install a usable system.
      </para>
      <para>
	The following steps are almost fully automated and the user is only
	prompted at the end of the installation to provide more information
	about the system.
      </para>
      <para>
	&autoyast2; comes into action where user intervention is  required or
	where customization is required. Using  a control file, &yast2;
	prepares the system for a custom installation and avoids any
	interaction with the user, unless specified in the control file.
      </para>
      <para>
	&autoyast2; is not an automated GUI system. This means that in most
	cases many screen will be skipped, i.e. you will never see the language
	selection interface. &autoyast2; will simply pass the language
	parameter to the sub-system without displaying any language related
	interface.
      </para>

      <title>Overview and Concept</title>
      <para>
      Using AutoYaST2, multiple systems sharing the same environment and
      hardware performing similar tasks can easily be installed in parallel. A
      configuration  file (referred to as "control  file") is created using
      existing configuration resources. The control file can be easily tailored for any
      specific environment. 
    </para>
   
    
    <para>
      Unlike autoinstallation systems available with older &company-suse;
      releases, &autoyast2 is fully integrated and provides various options for
      installing and configuring a system. The important advantage over older
      systems and other autoinstall systems is the possibility to configure the
      system by using existing modules and not by using custom scripts which
      are normally executed at the end of the installation.

      The following chapters will guide you through the three steps of
      auto-installation:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Prepare: All relevant information about the target system is
  collected and turned into the appropriate directives of the control
  file. The control file is transferred onto the target system where
  its directives will be parsed and transformed to &yast2; conforming
	  data. </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Install:  follows the instructions given in the  control file and
	  installs a base system.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Configure:  &yast2; and some user-defined post-install
	  scripts accomplish the system configuration
	</para>
