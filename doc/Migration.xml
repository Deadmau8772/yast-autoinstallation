    <para>
      ALICE, SuSE's former auto-installation system was a system built around
      the auto-installation features that were available with &yast1;. In order
      to able to use existing ALICE configuration files and resources, a
      special package is provided which will enable you to convert
      ALICE system configuration files into a control file readable by
      &autoyast2; using the configuration management system.

	Interface with &yast1; and &alice;
      </title>
      <para>
	&alice; uses &yast1; for the installation of the Linux System. This is
	done by creating a boot medium with the needed control file (<filename>info</filename>)
	from a set of configuration files maintained in a CVS repository. The
	<emphasis>info</emphasis> file has the traditional format used with &yast1;.

	System Configuration with &alice;
      </title>
      <para>
	The system configuration is done almost entirely after the system is
	installed and is initiated as the <emphasis>%post</emphasis> section of the &alice; RPM
	package.

	  &alice; modules
	</title>
	<para>	
	  Each of ALICE modules perform certain tasks and requires one or
	  multiple configuration files. The modules are shell scripts that are
	  envoked after installation of the machine to set different things up. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  &yast2; offers an extensive and rich interface to the installed system
	  which replaces most of these modules available with &alice; 
	  The following is a list of all &alice; modules, their
	  function and how their functionality is provided by &yast2; modules which are
	  already available or which can be integrated easily:
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  The  modules <emphasis>prepare_alice</emphasis> and
	  <emphasis>make_all</emphasis> provided the base and main scripts of all
	  &alice; modules.	  
	  The module <emphasis>prepare_alice</emphasis> is called right after the initial
	  installation process - which is done after &yast1; is  finished
	  with the basic installation.
	</para>
	<para>
	  With &yast2;, the alternative to these modules is  part of the system
	  and is not an addition or extension. This means that &yast2; configures
	  the system in one single process and not, as with &alice; in two
	  different, independent steps.
	</para>
	<para>The following table show how the result of some &alice modules
	  can be accomplished with &yast2;

	  Entries in <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename> can be easily set and
