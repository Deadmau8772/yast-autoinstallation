  <para>
    By default, the auto-installation process has to be confirmed by the
    user. The confirmation should be disabled if a fully unattended
    installation is desired. This option is used to view and change the
    settings on a target system before anything is committed and can be
    used for debugging. It is set to <emphasis>true</emphasis> by default
    to avoid recursive installs when the system schedules a reboot after
    initial system setup.
  </para>
  <para>
     With <emphasis>halt</emphasis> you make autoyast to turn off the machine
     after all packages have been installed. So instead of the reboot into
     stage two, the machine is turned off. The bootloader is alreay installed
     and all your chroot scripts have run.
  </para>
  <para>
     <emphasis>final_halt</emphasis> and <emphasis>final_reboot</emphasis> are new
     with openSUSE 11.0 and SLES11. You can reboot or halt the machine,
     when everything with installation and configuration is done, with that.
  </para>
    <para>
      openSUSE 11.0 uses the kexec feature and does not reboot anymore between stage1 and stage2. With
      the <emphasis>forceboot</emphasis> option you can force the reboot in case you need it for some
      reason. true will reboot, false will not reboot and a missing <emphasis>forceboot</emphasis> option
      uses the products default.
    </para>
    <para>
      AutoYaST in openSUSE 11.1 allows you to configure the proposal screen with the &lt;proposals config:type="list"&gt;
      option in the profile. All proposals that are listed in that section are shown in the proposal screen if you set the
      <emphasis>confirm</emphasis> option to true.
    </para>
    <para>
      This is the list of proposals for openSUSE 11.1 are (you can find that in the control.xml on the installation source too):

        The wait section was invented with openSUSE 11.1 and SLES11. You can let AutoYaST sleep before and after each module during the second stage. 
        You can run scripts and/or you can pass a value (in seconds) for AutoYaST to sleep. In the example above AutoYaST will sleep for 15 seconds (10+5) before
        the network configuration happens and 10 seconds (3+7) after the network configuration is done. The scripts in the example don't really make a lot of sense
        because you could pass that value as "time" value too but I think you get how scripts in the wait section work now.
    </para>
     <note>
	<title>Change starting from SUSE Linux 10.1/SLES10</title>
	<para>
	  The <emphasis>language</emphasis>, <emphasis>keyboard</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>clock</emphasis> properties in the <emphasis>general</emphasis>
	  resource were moved to the root (<emphasis>profile</emphasis>) element of
      the autoyast profile. So don't use them in the general section anymore.
	</para>
    <para>
      Since now you can use the <emphasis>second_stage</emphasis> property, which
      can turn off autoyast after the first reboot. So the complete second stage is
      a manual installation (default is true, which means that autoyast is doing a
      complete installation). Since openSUSE 11.0 you can set the boolean <emphasis>final_reboot</emphasis>
      and <emphasis>final_halt</emphasis> to reboot/turn off the machine at the end of stage two.
    </para>

      For the signature-handling, please read the <emphasis>Software</emphasis> chapter
      of this documentation.
