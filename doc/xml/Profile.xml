      The control file is in most cases a  configuration description for a
      single system. It consists of
      sets of resources with properties including support for complex
      structures representations such as lists, records,  trees and large
      embedded or referenced objects.

      Format
    </title>    
    
    <para>
      The XML configuration format provides a consistent file structure, which is
      easier to learn and remember when attempting to configure a new system.     
    </para>
    <para>
      Using XML, you can eliminate (nearly) all of the configuration
      file parsing and error handling - an external  XML parser can do that instead
      - (especially if it is a validating parser). To make sure the control file is
      well-formatted and that the syntax is valid, you can run the control file
      through a validating parser before it is actually used for automatic
      installation. This is especially required if you prefer to edit the
      profile manually.

	Resources and Properties

      <para>
	A resource element either contains multiple and distinct property and
	resource elements or contains multiple instances of the same resource
	element or is empty. The permissible content of a resource element is
	specified in the schema files.
      </para>
      <para>
	A property element is either empty or contains a literal value. The
	permissible property elements and values in each resource element are
	specified in the schema files
      </para>
      <para>
	An element can be either a container of other elements (a resource) or
	have a literal value (a property), it can never be both. This
	restriction is specified in the schema files. A configuration component with
	more than one value must either be represented as some kind of embedded
	list in a property value or as a nested resource.

      <para>
	In the example above the disk resource consists of a device property
	and a partitions resource. The partitions resource contains multiple
	instances of the partition resource. Each partition resource contains a
	size and mount property.	
      </para>
      <para>
	Although it is specified in the schema files that the partitions resource
	contains multiple instances, it is still required to specify this to
	avoid wrong data typing in &yast2;. Using the example above, imagine having  a
	drive with only one partition. This will result in interpreting the
	partition resource as a property. To avoid this the following syntax
	must be used when defining multiple instances. For more information
	about type attributes, see next section.

	Attributes
      </title>
      <para>
	Global profile attributes are used to define meta-data on resources and
	properties. Attributes are used to define  context switching. They are also used for naming and
	typing properties as shown in earlier sectionons.

	    Profile attributes are in a separate namespace so they don't have
	    to be treated as reserved words in the default namespace. New ones
	    can then be added without having to potentially alter existing
	    profiles.
      </para>
      <para>
	Profile attributes are defined in the configuration namespace and must
	always be prefixed with <emphasis>config:</emphasis> . All profile attributes are
	optional. Most can be used with both resource and property elements but
	some can only be used with one type of element which is specified in
	the schema files. 
      </para>
   
    
    <para>
      The type of an element is defined using the <emphasis>config:type</emphasis> attribute. The
      type of a resource element is always RESOURCE , although this can
      also be made explicit with this attribute (to ensure correct
      identification of an empty element for example when there is no schema file
      to refer to). A resource element cannot be any other type and this
      restriction is specified in the schema file. The type of a property element
      determines the interpretation of its literal value. The type of a
      property element defaults to <emphasis>STRING</emphasis> , as specified in the schema file. The
      full set of permissible types is specified in the schema file.

	Introduction

      <para>
A RELAX NG schema specifies a pattern for the structure and content of an XML document.
A RELAX NG schema thus identifies a class of XML documents consisting of those documents that match the pattern.
A RELAX NG schema is itself an XML document.
