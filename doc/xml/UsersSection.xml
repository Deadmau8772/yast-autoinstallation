    <para>
      The root user and at least one normal user can be added during install
      using data supplied in the control file. User data and passwords
      (encrypted or in clear text) are part of the <emphasis>configure</emphasis> resource in the
      control file.
    </para>     
    <para>
      At least the root user should be configured during
      auto-installation so you can login after the 
      installation is finished. It will also ensure nobody else can login
      to the system (in case the password is not set).
  </para> 
  <para>The two users in the following example are added during system
      configuration.</para>

      <para>
          The last example shows the minimal information required for adding
          users. Additional options are available for a more customized user
          account management. The data in
          <filename>/etc/default/useradd</filename> is used to determine the
          home directory of the user to be created as well as other
          parameters.
