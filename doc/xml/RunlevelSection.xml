      Services and Run-levels
    </title>
    <para>
      With the run-level resource you can set the default run-level and specify
      in detail which system services you want to be started in which
      run-level.
    </para>
    <para>
      The default property specifies the <emphasis>default</emphasis> run
      level of the system. Changes to the default run-level will take effect
      the next time you boot the system. After installation is completed,
      the system has run-level 5, which is  <emphasis>Full multiuser with
	network and XDM</emphasis>. If you have configured a system with no
      X11, then it is recommended to reboot the system after the first stage
      using the <emphasis>reboot</emphasis> property in the <emphasis>general</emphasis> resource.

    </para>
    <para>
      A service should run in using a space delimited list of the run-levels
      as shown in the  following example. An alternative to specifying the
      exact run-levels is to change the status of the service by either
      enabling or disabling it using the
      <emphasis>service_status</emphasis> property.
