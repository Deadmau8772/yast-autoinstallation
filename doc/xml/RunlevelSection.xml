      Services and Runlevels
    </title>
    <para>
      With the runlevel resource you can set the default runlevel and specify
      in detail which system services you want to be started in which
      run-level.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <emphasis>default</emphasis> property specifies the default runlevel
      of the system. Changes to the default runlevel will take effect the next
      time you boot the system. After the installation is completed, the
      system runs in runlevel 5, which is <emphasis>full multiuser with
      network and XDM</emphasis>. If you have configured a system with no X11,
      it is recommended to reboot the system after stage 1, using the
      <emphasis>reboot</emphasis> property in the <emphasis>general</emphasis>
      resource.<remark>emap 2011-11-05: Something missing, like setting
      "default" to runlevel 3?</remark>
    </para>
    <para>
      Specify in which runlevels a service should run via a space separated
      list of the runlevels, as shown in the following example. Alternatively
      change the status of the service by either enabling or disabling it
      using the <emphasis>service_status</emphasis> property.
