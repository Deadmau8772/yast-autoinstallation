    <para>
        The mode section configures the behavior of &ay; with regard to confirmation and rebooting. The following has to be in the &lt;general&gt;&lt;mode&gt; section.
    </para>
  <para><remark>emap 2011-11-05: variable name is not specified, I assume it's
  'confirm' as in the commented table below.</remark> By default, the user
  must confirm the auto-installation process. This option allows the user to
  view and change the settings for a target system before they are committed
  and can be used for debugging. <emphasis>confirm</emphasis> is set to "true"
  by default to avoid recursive installs when the system schedules a reboot
  after initial system setup. Only disable confirmation if you want to carry
  out a fully unattended installation.
  </para>
  <para>
     With <emphasis>halt</emphasis> you cause &ay; to shut down the machine
     after all packages have been installed. Instead of a reboot into
     stage two, the machine is turned off. The bootloader is alreay installed
     and all your chroot scripts have run.
  </para>
  <para>
     <emphasis>final_halt</emphasis> and <emphasis>final_reboot</emphasis>
     have been introduced with openSUSE 11.0 and SLES11. You can reboot or
     halt the machine after installation and configuration are finished at the
     end of stage 2.
  </para>
  <para>
      openSUSE 11.0 uses the kexec feature and does
      not reboot anymore between stage1 and stage2. With the
      <emphasis>forceboot</emphasis> option you can force the reboot in case
      you need it for some reason. The value "true" will reboot, "false" will
      not reboot and a missing <emphasis>forceboot</emphasis> option uses the
      product's default.
      <remark>emap 2011-11-05: Fixed some issues above according to the commented additional information in the table below.</remark>

        The <emphasis>wait</emphasis> section has been introduced with openSUSE
        11.1 and SLES11. You can let &ay; <command>sleep</command> before and
        after each module run during the second stage.  You can run scripts
        and/or pass a value (in seconds) for &ay; to sleep. In the example
        above &ay; will sleep for 15 seconds (10+5) before the network
        configuration starts and 10 seconds (3+7) after the network
        configuration is done. The scripts in the example don't really make a
        lot of sense because you could pass that value as "time" value
        too. They are only used to show how scripts in the wait section
        work now.
    </para>
     <note>
	<title>Changes since SUSE Linux 10.1/SLES10</title>
	<para>
	  The <emphasis>language</emphasis>, <emphasis>keyboard</emphasis> and
	  <emphasis>clock</emphasis> properties in the
	  <emphasis>general</emphasis> resource were moved to the root
	  (<emphasis>profile</emphasis>) element of the autoyast profile. Do
	  not use them in the general section anymore.
	</para>
    <para>
      Now you can use the <emphasis>second_stage</emphasis> property to turn off &ay; after the first reboot (set to "false"). Then the complete second stage is a manual installation. Default is "true", which means &ay; is doing a
      complete installation. Since openSUSE 11.0 you can set the boolean <emphasis>final_reboot</emphasis>
      and <emphasis>final_halt</emphasis> to reboot or turn off the machine at the end of stage 2.
